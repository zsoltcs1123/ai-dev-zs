# Signs of AI Writing — Detection Checklist

Condensed from [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing) (WikiProject AI Cleanup). Use this to flag AI-generated patterns in text under review.

## Content Patterns

### 1. Inflated significance / legacy language
**Watch for:** "stands/serves as", "testament/reminder", "pivotal/crucial/vital role", "underscores/highlights importance", "reflects broader", "enduring/lasting", "setting the stage", "key turning point", "evolving landscape", "indelible mark"

Flag when the text inflates importance of mundane aspects or adds unsupported claims about broader significance.

### 2. Notability / media name-dropping
**Watch for:** listing media outlets without context ("featured in NYT, BBC, and Wired"), "active social media presence", "written by a leading expert"

Flag when sources are listed for impressiveness rather than backing a specific claim.

### 3. Superficial -ing analyses
**Watch for:** trailing participle phrases — "highlighting...", "underscoring...", "ensuring...", "reflecting...", "symbolizing...", "showcasing...", "fostering...", "contributing to..."

Flag when -ing clauses are tacked on to fake depth rather than add real information.

### 4. Promotional / ad-copy tone
**Watch for:** "boasts a", "vibrant", "rich" (figurative), "profound", "nestled", "in the heart of", "groundbreaking", "renowned", "breathtaking", "must-visit", "stunning", "showcasing", "commitment to"

Flag when neutral subject matter gets travel-brochure or press-release treatment.

### 5. Vague attributions / weasel words
**Watch for:** "Industry reports", "Observers have cited", "Experts argue", "Some critics argue", "several sources" (with few or no citations)

Flag when opinions are attributed to unnamed authorities.

### 6. Formulaic "Challenges and Future Prospects"
**Watch for:** "Despite its... faces several challenges...", "Despite these challenges", "Future Outlook", optimistic pivot after listing problems

Flag when a section follows the template: acknowledge problems → pivot to optimism with no specifics.

## Language & Grammar Patterns

### 7. Overused AI vocabulary
**High-frequency words:** Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adj.), landscape (abstract), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

Flag clusters of these words — one alone isn't diagnostic, but 3+ in a passage is a strong signal.

### 8. Copula avoidance
**Watch for:** "serves as", "stands as", "represents", "boasts", "features", "offers" used where "is", "are", or "has" would be natural

Flag when simple verbs are systematically replaced with elaborate substitutes.

### 9. Negative parallelisms
**Watch for:** "Not only...but...", "It's not just about..., it's...", "It's not merely..., it's..."

Flag when overused to create false rhetorical weight.

### 10. Rule-of-three overuse
Flag when ideas are forced into triples for perceived completeness ("innovation, inspiration, and industry insights").

### 11. Elegant variation (synonym cycling)
Flag when the same referent gets a new synonym every sentence ("the protagonist", "the main character", "the central figure", "the hero").

### 12. False ranges
**Watch for:** "from X to Y" where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale

Flag pseudo-ranges used for sweeping effect.

---

## Style Patterns

### 13. Em dash overuse
Flag if em dashes (—) appear significantly more often than in typical human writing for the genre.

### 14. Mechanical boldface
Flag when bolding is applied formulaically rather than for genuine emphasis.

### 15. Inline-header vertical lists
Flag bullet lists where every item starts with a **bolded label:** followed by a colon.

### 16. Title Case in headings
Flag if headings capitalize every main word when the document's convention is sentence case.

### 17. Emoji decoration
Flag emojis used as bullet markers or heading decoration.

### 18. Curly quotation marks
Flag curly quotes ("\u201c...\u201d") if the rest of the document uses straight quotes.

---

## Communication Artifacts

### 19. Chatbot residue
**Watch for:** "I hope this helps", "Of course!", "Certainly!", "You're absolutely right!", "Would you like...", "Let me know", "Here is a..."

Flag conversational artifacts that shouldn't appear in finished prose.

### 20. Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers
**Watch for:** "as of [date]", "While specific details are limited...", "based on available information..."

Flag AI hedging about its own training data that was left in the text.

### 21. Sycophantic tone
Flag overly agreeable or people-pleasing language ("Great question!", "That's an excellent point!").

---

## Filler & Hedging

### 22. Filler phrases
**Watch for:** "In order to" (→ "To"), "Due to the fact that" (→ "Because"), "At this point in time" (→ "Now"), "has the ability to" (→ "can"), "It is important to note that" (→ drop it)

### 23. Excessive hedging
Flag over-qualified statements: "could potentially possibly be argued that... might have some effect".

### 24. Generic positive conclusions
Flag vague upbeat endings: "The future looks bright", "Exciting times lie ahead", "a major step in the right direction".

---

## Soullessness (absence of human voice)

Even text free of the above patterns can feel AI-generated if it lacks personality:

- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions — just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when it would be natural
- No humor, edge, or personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

Flag if the text is technically clean but feels voiceless or algorithmic.
