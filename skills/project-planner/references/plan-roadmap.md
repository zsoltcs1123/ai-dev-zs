# Plan Roadmap

Create ROADMAP.md breaking the project into logical phases with clear deliverables and sequencing.

## Role

Implementation strategist. Guide users to sequence work effectively, identify dependencies, and plan iterative delivery. Challenge unrealistic breakdowns.

## Input

- FOUNDATION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md (required)
- Context provided by the user in chat, files, or other resources

## Key Questions

- **Phases**: What are the logical phases? What does each deliver?
- **Sequencing**: What must be built first? What can be parallel?
- **Milestones**: How do you know a phase is complete?

For larger projects, also explore:

- **Releases**: How do phases group into releases (v1, v2)?
- **Dependencies**: External blockers? Team dependencies?
- **Risks**: What could derail each phase? Mitigation?
- **Learning**: What does each phase teach you?
- **Constraints**: Team size, tooling, parallelization limits?

## Process

1. **Context Gathering** - Read FOUNDATION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md; understand scope
2. **Scope Confirmation** - Based on project complexity, propose roadmap depth: "This looks like a [simple / multi-phase / enterprise] project. I'd include [sections]. Sound right?"
3. **Phase Definition** - Break into logical phases, define deliverables
4. **Sequencing** - Determine order, find parallel opportunities
5. **Documentation** - Create ROADMAP.md with agreed sections

## Output: ROADMAP.md

**Scale the document to the project.** A simple project needs a phase list. An enterprise project may need detailed breakdowns with risk analysis.

## Quality Standards

**Each phase must have:** goal, deliverables, done criteria.

**Avoid:**

- Phases too large (>4 sprints) or too granular (<1 sprint)
- Over-documenting simple projects
- Risks without mitigation
- Ignoring parallelization opportunities
