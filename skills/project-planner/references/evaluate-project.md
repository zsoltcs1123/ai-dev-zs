# Evaluate Project

Perform an independent evaluation of existing project plans to assess feasibility, identify risks, and provide actionable recommendations.

## Role

Independent technical evaluator. Assess plans objectively, identify blind spots, challenge assumptions, and provide honest feedback. Prioritize technical accuracy over validation of existing decisions.

## Input

- FOUNDATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md (required — whatever exists)
- Additional context: company overview, team structure, market context (if available)

## Key Questions

- **Viability**: Is this project achievable with stated resources?
- **Risks**: What could go wrong? Are mitigations adequate?
- **Gaps**: What's missing from the plans?

For larger projects, also explore:

- **Architecture**: Are technology choices justified? Over-engineered?
- **Scope**: Is v1/MVP realistic? Are boundaries clear?
- **Timeline**: Are estimates realistic? What's on critical path?
- **Resources**: Is team capacity sufficient? Skill gaps?
- **Dependencies**: What's outside the team's control?
- **Assumptions**: Which are high-risk if invalid?

## Process

1. **Read** all planning documents
2. **Scope Confirmation** - Based on project complexity, propose evaluation depth: "This is a [simple / medium / complex] project. I'd do [quick review / standard evaluation / full framework analysis]. Sound right?"
3. **Apply frameworks** appropriate to scope
4. **Identify gaps** and validate assumptions
5. **Document** findings in EVALUATION.MD

## Evaluation Frameworks

### Required: Risk Assessment

Always perform basic risk analysis: `| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Status |`

### Optional Frameworks

Include based on project complexity:

| Framework              | Include When                               | Format / Fields                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SWOT Analysis          | Strategic projects needing broader context | Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats                                        |
| RICE Scoring           | Multiple components need prioritization    | Reach (users affected), Impact (Crit/High/Med/Low), Confidence (%), Effort, Priority |
| Feasibility Assessment | Per-phase viability ratings needed         | Phase, Feasibility (✅/⚠️/❌), Confidence, Notes                                     |
| Timeline Assessment    | Complex schedules with dependencies        | Realistic? Variance? Critical path risks?                                            |

## Output: EVALUATION.md

**Scale the evaluation to the project.** A simple project needs 1-2 pages. A complex enterprise project may need comprehensive framework analysis.

## Quality Standards

**Be honest**: Flag real concerns over politeness.

**Be specific**: "Phase 2 may slip 2 sprints due to OAuth2 complexity" not "timeline may be optimistic."

**Be actionable**: Every concern needs a recommendation.

**Avoid**:

- Rubber-stamping without critical analysis
- Vague concerns without evidence
- Over-analyzing simple projects
- Excessive negativity without alternatives
